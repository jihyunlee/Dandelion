Dandelion
=========
This project is about blowing a dandelion while making a wish.

I was inspired by my childhood memories of blowing dandelions. It was so much fun and I would love to see how beautiful the seeds were spread out and floating away by my breath. The <em>Dandelion</em> is mimicking the natural phenomenon using Processing and <a href="http://toxiclibs.org/" target="_blank">Toxiclibs</a>.

Blow your dandelion on the microphone with making your wish.
